      Apple Inc. is an American multinational technology company that
      specializes in consumer electronics, computer software, and online
      services. Apple is the world's largest technology company by revenue
      (totaling $274.5 billion in 2020) and, since January 2021, the world's
      most valuable company. As of 2021, Apple is the world's fourth-largest PC
      vendor by unit sales,[9] and fourth-largest smartphone
      manufacturer.[10][11] It is one of the Big Five American information
      technology companies,<br />
      along with Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Facebook.[12][13][14] Apple was
      founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne in 1976 to develop
      and sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. It was incorporated by Jobs
      and Wozniak as Apple Computer, Inc. in 1977, and sales <br />
      of its computers, including the Apple II, grew quickly. It went public in
      1980 to instant financial success. Over the next few years, Apple shipped
      new computers featuring innovative graphical user interfaces, such as the
      original<br Macintosh, announced with the critically acclaimed
      advertisement "1984". However, the high price of its products and limited
      application library caused problems, as did power struggles between
      executives. In 1985, Wozniak departed Apple amicably,[15] while Jobs
      resigned to found NeXT, taking some Apple co-workers with him.[16] As the
      market for personal computers expanded and evolved through the 1990s,
      Apple lost considerable market share to the lower-priced duopoly of
      Microsoft Windows on Intel PC clones. The board recruited CEO Gil Amelio,
      who prepared the struggling company for eventual success with extensive
      reforms, product focus and layoffs in his 500-day tenure. In 1997, Amelio
      bought NeXT, to resolve Apple unsuccessful operating system strategy and
      bring back Steve Jobs, who replaced Amelio as CEO later that year. Apple
      returned to profitability under the revitalizing different campaign,
      launching the iMac and iPod, opening a retail chain of Apple Stores in
      2001, and acquiring numerous companies to broaden their software
      portfolio. In 2007, the company launched the iPhone to critical acclaim
      and financial success. In 2011, Jobs resigned as CEO due to health
      complications, and died two months later. He was succeeded by Tim Cook.
