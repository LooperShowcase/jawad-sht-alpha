    <h1>
      Apple Watch is a line of smartwatches produced by Apple Inc. It
      incorporates fitness tracking, health-oriented capabilities, and wireless
      telecommunication, and integrates with iOS and other Apple products and
      services. The Apple Watch was released in April 2015[18][19] and quickly
      became the best-selling wearable device: 4.2 million were sold in the
      second quarter of fiscal 2015,[20][21] and more than 100 million people
      were estimated to use an Apple Watch as of December 2020.[22] Apple has
      introduced new generations of the Apple Watch with improved internal
      components each September[23][24][25][26]—each labeled by Apple a
      'Series', with certain exceptions.[a] Each Series has been initially sold
      in multiple variants defined by the watch casing's material, color, and
      size (except for the budget watches Series 1 and SE, available only in
      aluminum[27][29]), and beginning with Series 3, by the option in the
      aluminum variants for LTE cellular connectivity, which comes standard with
      the other materials.[30] The band included with the watch <br />
      can be selected from multiple options from Apple, and watch variants in
      aluminum co-branded with Nike and in stainless steel co-branded with
      Hermès are also offered, which include exclusive bands and digital watch
      faces carrying those companies' brandings.
