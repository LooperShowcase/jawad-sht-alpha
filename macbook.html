      The MacBook Pro is a line of Macintosh notebook computers introduced in
      January 2006 by Apple Inc. It is the higher-end model of the MacBook
      family, sitting above the consumer-focused <br />
      MacBook Air, and is currently sold with 13-inch, 14-inch, and 16-inch
      screens. All current models of the MacBook Pro use variants of the
      Apple-designed M1 system on a chip. The first-generation MacBook Pro used
      the design <br />
      of the PowerBook G4, but replaced the PowerPC G4 chips with Intel Core
      processors, added a webcam, and introduced the MagSafe power connector.
      The 15-inch model was introduced in January 2006; the 17-inch model in
      April. Later revisions added Intel Core 2 Duo processors and LED-backlit
      displays. The second-generation model debuted in October 2008 in 13- and
      15-inch variants, with a 17-inch variant added in January 2009. Called the
      "unibody" model because its case was machined from a single piece of
      aluminum, it had a thinner flush display, a redesigned trackpad whose
      entire surface <br />
      consisted of a single clickable button, and a redesigned keyboard. Updates
      brought Intel Core i5 and i7 processors and introduced Intel's
      Thunderbolt. The third-generation MacBook Pro was released in 2012: the
      15-inch in June 2012, a 13-inch model in October. It is thinner than its
      predecessor, made solid-state storage (SSD) standard, added HDMI, and
      included a high-resolution Retina display. It eliminated Ethernet and
      FireWire ports and the optical drive.
